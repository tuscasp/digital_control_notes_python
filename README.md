# Digital Control Notes in Python

This repository is the result of my studies on digital control as a student of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

It is basically a collection of jupyter notebooks, where I cover some keypoints on this topic. It is being developed as I am following the classes, then it might be either imcomplete or clumsy. I will do my best to improve and complete it as soon as possible.

By sharing it, I want to:
- give other students an intuition on what all this crazy (and beautiful) maths means;
- help people who are struggling to understand how to do use Python for studying and designing control systems.

It means that if you want some deep understanding on the maths and developments of the theory you might be on the wrong place. In this case, you may refeer to one of the great textbooks on the subject, such as [[1]](#1).

Although I try to be as correct as I can, I am not a specialist on the subject. In the first place, it means that you should not use it as your personal reference for studing digital control theory. But more importantly, if you find any mistakes that should be corrected or if you want to improve anything here, your contribution will be welcomed :)
